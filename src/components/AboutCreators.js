        <h1>About us</h1>

        <p>
          Laura Ferraz e Leonardo Uezu, project creators, are Web Development
          students at Ironhack SÃ£o Paulo and this was their second project at
          the bootcamp.
        </p>

        <h3>Laura Ferraz</h3>
        <p>
          Graduated in Tourism, she worked for 3 years in the area and decided
          to change her career because she didn't feel fulfilled with the work
          she performed. In early 2020 she found her new path in programming.
        </p>
        <p>
          After research and short courses, she enrolled in Ironhack's full-time
          Web Development Full-Stack bootcamp lasting 9 weeks and concluded in
          December / 20.

        <h3>Leonardo Uezu</h3>

        <p>
          As a technology student, I was very curious about the possibilities
          that I could have, but little contact with Java and C ++, I ended up
          becoming more interested in the Front-end area.
        </p>

        <p style={{paddingBottom:"50px"}}>
          I am always looking to update myself and seek new knowledge, currently
          I am focusing my learning in Javascript and React.
